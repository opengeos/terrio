# Formats

Drivers are named as GDAL names them, so `-f GTiff` or `-f "ESRI Shapefile"` mean the same in
terrio. `terrio formats` prints this list.

## Rasters

GeoTIFF compression: none, LZW, Deflate (including the legacy code), PackBits, JPEG, WebP and
Zstandard, with horizontal and floating-point predictors, tiled or striped, chunky or planar.
netCDF variables are opened as `NETCDF:"file.nc":variable`, as in GDAL.

## Vectors

| Name | Format | Read | Write | Extensions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GPKG | GeoPackage | ✓ | ✓ | gpkg |
| Parquet | GeoParquet | ✓ | ✓ | parquet, geoparquet |
| FlatGeobuf | FlatGeobuf | ✓ | ✓ | fgb |
| ESRI Shapefile | Shapefile | ✓ | ✓ | shp |
| GeoJSON | GeoJSON | ✓ | ✓ | geojson, json |
| CSV | CSV with X/Y or WKT columns | ✓ | ✓ | csv, tsv |
| KML | KML | ✓ | ✓ | kml |
| KMZ | Zipped KML | ✓ | ✓ | kmz |
| GML | GML | ✓ | ✓ | gml |
| GPX | GPS Exchange Format | ✓ | ✓ | gpx |
| TopoJSON | TopoJSON | ✓ | ✓ | topojson |
| MapInfo File | MapInfo interchange format | ✓ | ✓ | mif |
| OSM | OpenStreetMap PBF | ✓ | | osm.pbf |

Layer and field models follow GDAL's: GPX has GDAL's five layers, KML has the LIBKML driver's
fields, OSM has the `points`, `lines`, `multilinestrings`, `multipolygons` and `other_relations`
layers, and shapefile field names are truncated as GDAL truncates them.

## In WebAssembly

The browser and Node.js package reads from bytes. JPEG 2000 is not available there, and
Shapefile, MapInfo and GeoPackage can be read from files but not yet from bytes.
