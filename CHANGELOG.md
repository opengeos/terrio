## Unreleased

### CRS compatibility

- Transformer construction now checks celestial-body compatibility for all CRS
  pairs, including custom PROJ definitions without IAU identifiers. Different
  known bodies are rejected. When either body is unidentified, semi-major axes
  must agree within 0.7% of the target radius. For example, `+R=1` to `+R=2`, or a
  lunar/custom small sphere to EPSG:4326, now returns an error; matching custom
  figures remain supported.
- Earth datum operations (`+datum`, `+towgs84`, or datum grids) require an Earth
  figure, including for otherwise matching unidentified custom radii. They are
  rejected on planetary/custom small figures rather than interpreted as valid
  Earth shifts. This intentionally also applies without IAU identifiers. There
  is no `PROJ_IGNORE_CELESTIAL_BODY` override in Rust, CLI/MCP, Python or
  JavaScript. Use a CRS on the correct body; changes of arbitrary coordinate
  units should use the applicable CRS unit parameters.
