# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Formats

- SRTM HGT tiles are read and written (the `SRTMHGT` driver), as GDAL's SRTMHGT
  driver does: 3", 1" and 0.5" tiles georeferenced from their name
  (`N37W120.hgt`), `.hgt.zip` archives, and the NASADEM and water body variants.
  Tiles are written as Int16 with -32768 for nodata; a grid of another size is
  refused.
- SRTM HGT tiles and the other raw-layout rasters (EHdr, ENVI, SAGA, ERS,
  Idrisi, Surfer 6 binary grids) are read in place (#333): `open_raster_lazy`
  reads only the header, a window reads only the rows it covers, and `info`
  decodes no pixels. Remote SRTM tiles are read with HTTP range requests, and
  `convert` to a GeoTIFF or COG writes these inputs a strip at a time.

### Remote I/O

- Signed S3 uploads of local files over 8 MiB sent over HTTPS read the file once
  per attempt instead of twice (#335), as a retried, redirected or
  region-rerouted request reads it again: they are signed with
  `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`, as the AWS SDKs sign S3 uploads over HTTPS, and the body
  is streamed. The signature no longer covers the body of these uploads; TLS
  protects it in transit. Over plain HTTP, and for smaller or staged uploads,
  the payload hash is signed as before.

### Breaking changes

- Signed S3 uploads of local files over 8 MiB over HTTPS use `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`
  (#335). An S3-compatible service, or a bucket policy, that refuses it now
  rejects those uploads; they can be sent over plain HTTP to keep a signed
  payload, with `AWS_HTTPS=NO`, or an `http://` `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT` when the
  endpoint names its scheme (an `https://` endpoint ignores `AWS_HTTPS`).
- `mosaic`, `warp`, `concat` and `filter merge` now treat an input beginning
  with `@` as a file list, so a file named `@name.tif` must be written
  `./@name.tif`.
- WKT2 `Goode Homolosine` (PROJ's uninterrupted `goode`) is refused; it was read
  as `igh`.

### Command line

- `mosaic`, `warp`, `concat` and `filter merge` read inputs from a file list:
  `@FILE` stands for the paths listed in FILE, one per line, as GDAL's
  `--input @filelist.txt` does (#323). MCP tool calls refuse `@FILE`, so that a
  client cannot read a file back through the errors naming its lines.

### Point clouds

- PDAL's `filters.hexbin`: the boundary of points on a grid of hexagons (the hexagons with at
  least a threshold of points, as polygons with holes), with its area, density and point
  spacing, and the hexagons with their counts. `terrio filter hexbin` (and MCP) writes them as
  vector datasets, reading the points in chunks; Python's `PointCloud.hexbin` returns PDAL's
  metadata (`boundary` as WKT, `boundary_json`...) with both as layers; JavaScript's
  `PointCloud.hexbin` returns both as a vector dataset; Rust has `pointcloud::filters::hexbin`
  and `HexBinner`. PDAL's options (`edge_length`/`edge_size` or its estimate from
  `sample_size` points, `threshold`, `smooth`, `hole_cull_area_tolerance`, `precision`) and a
  grid `origin`; H3 grids are not implemented. Hexagons, counts and boundaries (smoothed or not)
  are identical to PDAL 2.10's on autzen; points are assigned to hexagons as hexer assigns them
  (a port, attributed in `NOTICE`).
- Reprojection (`terrio convert --t-srs`, `convert_points(t_srs=...)`,
  `PointCloud.reproject`, `append_points`) now transforms `z` when the points'
  CRS and the target CRS both have heights, as PDAL's `filters.reprojection`
  does: vertical units, geoid models and vertical datum transformations apply.
  It previously transformed only `x` and `y`, so 300 ftUS in
  `EPSG:6588+6360` stayed 300 in `EPSG:6588+5703` (now 91.44018 m). The
  vertical CRS a LAS file declares is now part of the CRS reprojected from
  (it was dropped) unless a CRS is assigned with `--a-srs`, and LAS files
  written with GeoKeys record a compound CRS's vertical CRS in
  `VerticalCSTypeGeoKey`. When only the target has heights, `z` is kept and a
  warning says so.

### CRS compatibility

- Transformer construction now checks celestial-body compatibility for all CRS
  pairs, including custom PROJ definitions without IAU identifiers. Different
  known bodies are rejected. When either body is unidentified, semi-major axes
  must agree within 0.7% of the target radius. For example, `+R=1` to `+R=2`, or a
  lunar/custom small sphere to EPSG:4326, now returns an error; matching custom
  figures remain supported.
- Earth datum operations (`+datum`, `+towgs84`, or datum grids) require an Earth
  figure, including for otherwise matching unidentified custom radii. They are
  rejected on planetary/custom small figures rather than interpreted as valid
  Earth shifts. This intentionally also applies without IAU identifiers. There
  is no `PROJ_IGNORE_CELESTIAL_BODY` override in Rust, CLI/MCP, Python or
  JavaScript. Use a CRS on the correct body; changes of arbitrary coordinate
  units should use the applicable CRS unit parameters.
- Geographic WKT2 definitions with west- or south-positive axes now preserve
  those directions and their declared order, including Earth CRSs. They were
  previously treated as ordinary east/north coordinates. This matches GDAL's
  traditional GIS axis strategy; ordinary north/east Earth axes still use
  longitude, latitude order.
- Vertical CRSs without geoid models of their own now use those of the vertical
  CRSs of their datum, as PROJ does. NAVD88 height in US survey feet
  (EPSG:6360) or feet (EPSG:8228) and NAVD88 depth (EPSG:6357, EPSG:6358) go
  through GEOID18 like NAVD88 height (EPSG:5703), in both directions, with the
  unit and direction converted. They previously only converted the unit,
  an error of the geoid undulation (about 21 to 28 m across Texas):
  `EPSG:6318+6360` to `EPSG:6319` at 30 N, 97 W turns 328.0833 ftUS
  (100 m) into 73.4074 m, as PROJ 9.9.0, instead of 100 m.

### Projections

- `+proj=igh` (interrupted Goode homolosine) is computed as PROJ does; it was
  refused. GDAL's WKT1 `Interrupted_Goode_Homolosine`, ESRI's
  `Goode_Homolosine` with `Option` 1 and WKT2 `Interrupted Goode Homolosine`
  are read, and the first is written.

### Warp

- With bilinear, cubic, cubic spline and Lanczos, an output pixel whose source
  pixel under the sample point is nodata (or cut out) is now left unwritten
  (at the output's nodata value, when it has one) for a single-band source too,
  as GDAL does: it took a value renormalised over the valid neighbours, which
  moved the edge of the data about a pixel into nodata areas. Several bands
  already behaved so, with unified nodata.

### Shapefile

- In polygon records of several parts, rings that touch themselves at a vertex
  to enclose a hole, which Esri allows, are now split into an exterior and
  holes when read, wherever the stored ring starts, as GDAL 3.13 does (GDAL
  3.12 keeps them as stored). A ring whose loops are not holes (a figure-eight,
  a loop outside the ring, a spike), and a record of a single ring, are still
  read as stored, also as GDAL does. The split rings start at the vertex the
  rings GEOS rebuilds for GDAL start at. The `shapefile-rings` conformance
  suite compares 18 such cases with GDAL.
- A hole whose first vertex lies on the exterior now belongs to that exterior.
  It was read as a polygon of its own.
